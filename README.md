![v3 Studio with @sanity/document-internationalization v1 Installed](./docs/img/sanity-document-internationalization-v2.png)

## What this plugin solves

There are two popular methods of internationalization in Sanity Studio:

- **Document-level translation**
  - A unique document version for every language
  - Joined together by references in a `translation.metadata` document
  - Best for documents that have unique, language-specific fields and no common content across languages
  - Best for translating content using Portable Text
- **Field-level translation**
  - A single document with many languages of content
  - Achieved by mapping over languages on each field
  - Best for documents that have a mix of language-specific and common fields
  - Not recommended for Portable Text

This plugin adds features to the Studio to improve handling **document-level translations**.

- A Language Selector to create and browse language-specific versions of a Document
- Hooks and components to use throughout your custom components to handle translations
- Document Badges to highlight the language version of a document

For **field-level translations** you should use the [sanity-plugin-internationalized-array](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-plugin-internationalized-array).

### Many projects use both

An example of **document-level** translation could be a `lesson` schema, the `title`, `slug` and `content` fields would be unique in every language.

A good use of **field-level** translation could be a `person` schema. It could have the same `name` and `image` in every language, but only the `biography` would need translating.

## Upgrade

[See the upgrade guide](./docs/00-upgrade-from-v1.md) for instructions on how to upgrade from the previous version of Document Internationalization.

## Install

```
npm install --save @sanity/document-internationalization
```

## Usage

Add it as a plugin in `sanity.config.ts` (or .js):

### Basic configuration

The only required configuration is:

- The `supportedLanguages` array and
- The `schemaTypes` array

```ts
// sanity.config.ts

import {createConfig} from 'sanity'
import {documentInternationalization} from '@sanity/document-internationalization'

export const createConfig({
  // ... all other config
  plugins: [
    // ... all other plugins
    documentInternationalization({
      // Required configuration
      supportedLanguages: [
        {id: 'es', title: 'Spanish'},
        {id: 'en', title: 'English'}
      ],
      schemaTypes: ['lesson'],
    })
  ]
})
```

### Advanced configuration

The plugin also supports asynchronously retrieving languages from the dataset, modifying the language field, adding a bulk publishing feature and adding additional fields to the metadata document.

```ts
// sanity.config.ts

import {createConfig} from 'sanity'
import {documentInternationalization} from '@sanity/document-internationalization'

export const createConfig({
  // ... all other config
  plugins: [
    // ... all other plugins
    documentInternationalization({
      // Required
      // Either: an array of supported languages...
      supportedLanguages: [
        {id: 'nb', title: 'Norwegian (Bokmål)'},
        {id: 'nn', title: 'Norwegian (Nynorsk)'},
        {id: 'en', title: 'English'}
      ],
      // ...or a function that takes the client and returns a promise of an array of supported languages
      // MUST return an "id" and "title" as strings
      // Note: Async language configuration cannot create templates for new documents
      // supportedLanguages: (client) => client.fetch(`*[_type == "language"]{id, title}`),

      // Required
      // Translations UI will only appear on these schema types
      schemaTypes: ['lesson'],

      // Optional
      // Customizes the name of the language field
      languageField: `language` // defauts to "language"

      // Optional
      // Keep translation.metadata references weak
      weakReferences: true // defaults to false

      // Optional
      // Adds UI for publishing all translations at once. Requires access to the Scheduling API
      // https://www.sanity.io/docs/scheduling-api
      bulkPublish: true // defaults to false

      // Optional
      // Adds additional fields to the metadata document
      metadataFields: [
        defineField({ name: 'slug', type: 'slug' })
      ],

      // Optional
      // Define API Version for all queries
      // https://www.sanity.io/docs/api-versioning
      apiVersion: '2023-05-22'
    })
  ]
})
```

### Language field

The schema types that use document internationalization must also have a `string` field type with the same name configured in the `languageField` setting. Unless you want content creators to be able to change the language of a document, you may hide or disable this field since the plugin will handle writing patches to it.

```ts
// ./schema/lesson.ts

// ...all other settings
defineField({
  // should match 'languageField' plugin configuration setting, if customized
  name: 'language',
  type: 'string',
  readOnly: true,
  hidden: true,
})
```

### Excluding fields

The default behaviour of this plugin when creating a new translation is to duplicate the originating document, which is useful for then translating the fields directly in the new document - perhaps with [Sanity AI Assist](https://github.com/sanity-io/assist). However, sometimes you may want to exclude certain fields from being copied to the new document. You can do this by updating your schema to exclude certain types or fields with `options.documentInternationalization.exclude`:

```ts
defineField({
  name: 'title',
  title: 'Title',
  type: 'string',
  options: {
    documentInternationalization: {
      exclude: true,
    },
  },
}),
```

## Querying translations

### Querying with GROQ

To query a single document and all its translations, we use the `references()` function in GROQ.

```json5
// All `lesson` documents of a single language
*[_type == "lesson" && language == $language]{
  title,
  slug,
  language,
  // Get the translations metadata
  // And resolve the `value` reference field in each array item
  "_translations": *[_type == "translation.metadata" && references(^._id)].translations[].value->{
    title,
    slug,
    language
  },
}
```

### Querying with GraphQL

Fortunately, the Sanity GraphQL API contains a similar filter for document references.

```graphql
# In this example we retrieve a lesson by its `slug.current` field value
query GetLesson($language: String!, $slug: String!) {
  allLesson(
    limit: 1
    where: {language: {eq: $language}, slug: {current: {eq: $slug}}}
  ) {
    _id
    title
    language
    slug {
      current
    }
  }
}

# And then can run this query to find translation metadata documents that use its ID
query GetTranslations($id: ID!) {
  allTranslationMetadata(where: {_: {references: $id}}) {
    translations {
      _key
      value {
        title
        slug {
          current
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Note on document quotas

In previous versions of this plugin, translations were stored as an array of references on the actual documents. This required a base language, lead to messy transaction histories and made deleting documents difficult.

In this version of the plugin, translations of a document are stored as an array of references in a separate document of the type `translation.metadata`, and one is created for every document that has translations. A document with no translations will not have a metadata document.

This means if you have 100 documents and they are all translated into 3 languages, you will have 400 documents. Keep this in mind for extremely high-volume datasets.
